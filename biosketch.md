David LeBauer is a research scientist at the University of Illinois as well as a Fellow with the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. 
His research focuses on the development and management of efficient and sustainable ecosystems using scientific understanding of how crops and ecosystems work combined with observations.
His work uses mechanistic models to interpret data from field measurements and remote sensing platforms to characterize and predict the response of ecosystems to different crops and management strategies.
To support this work, he has led development of a database used for agronomic decision support (BETYdb, betydb.org), software to manage crop and ecosystem modeling workflows (PEcAn, pecanproject.org) and the BioCro crop productivity model.
Open data / software / etc
He is also a Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry instructor helping to promote computational and data literacy among scientists.  
LeBauer received his bachelor’s degree in biology from Duke University. He went on to earn his master’s degree in agricultural ecology from the University of California, Davis, and his doctorate in earth system science from the University of California, Irvine (UCI).
