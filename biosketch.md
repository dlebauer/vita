David LeBauer is a research scientist at the University of Illinois as well as a Fellow with the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. 
His research focuses on the development and management of efficient and sustainable ecosystems using scientific understanding of how crops and ecosystems work to inform land use and crop improvement. 
His work uses mechanistic models to interpret available data and to predict the response of ecosystems to different crops and management strategies.
Interests in open science, open data, open software. 
To support this work, he has led development of the Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer and the Biofuel Ecophysiological Traits and Yields database.
Leads the development of the computing pipeline and informatics infrastructure for the TERRA REF program.
LeBauer received his bachelor’s degree in biology from Duke University. He went on to earn his master’s degree in agricultural ecology from the University of California, Davis, and his doctorate in earth system science from the University of California, Irvine (UCI).
